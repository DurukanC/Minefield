# Minefield
watch out for the bomb.
First of all this is a learning project. 
This project was built with the help of arrays.
In this project a 10x10 game board was created.There are 15 mines on the board.
The game starts with the row and column information requested from the user. Mines are written to be randomly scattered each time a game is started.
If there are no bombs in the rows and columns near the row and column numbers entered by the user, more than one field will be opened.
The important thing is to stay away from the mines and open all the rows and columns without stepping on the mines.
